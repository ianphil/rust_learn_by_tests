# Borrowing

To effectively demonstrate the concepts of pointers and borrowing in Rust, we should consider a variety of scenarios to cover the fundamental aspects and common use cases. Here's a proposed set of tests, along with their objectives:

1. [**test_immutable_borrowing**](docs/immutable_borrowing.md)
   - Demonstrates basic immutable borrowing, showing how a function can borrow a value immutably for read-only access.

2. [**test_mutable_borrowing**](docs/mutable_borrowing.md)
   - Explores mutable borrowing, illustrating how a function can borrow a value mutably to modify it.

3. [**test_multiple_immutable_borrows**](docs/multiple_immutable_borrows.md)
   - Highlights the rule that multiple immutable borrows are allowed at the same time.

4. [**test_mutable_and_immutable_borrowing_conflict**](docs/conflict_mutable_immutable.md)
   - Shows that Rust disallows simultaneous mutable and immutable borrowing, demonstrating the borrow checker's role in preventing data races.

5. [**test_lifetime_of_borrowed_reference**](docs/lifetime_of_borrowed.md)
   - Focuses on lifetimes, ensuring a borrowed reference does not outlive the data it references.

6. [**test_struct_borrowing**](docs/struct_borrowing.md)
   - Applies borrowing concepts to struct fields, demonstrating borrowing individual fields of a struct.

7. [**test_borrowing_in_loops**](docs/borrowing_loops.md)
   - Shows how to use borrowing within loops, a common scenario where borrowing rules need careful consideration.

8. [**test_dangling_pointer_prevention**](docs/dangling_pointer.md)
   - Illustrates Rustâ€™s prevention of dangling pointers through its borrowing and ownership rules.

9. [**test_borrowing_slices**](docs/borrowing_slices.md)
   - Demonstrates borrowing parts of a collection, like slices of an array or vector.

10. [**test_function_returning_borrowed_reference**](docs/returning_borrowed.md)
    - Explores the concept of returning borrowed references from functions and the associated lifetime considerations.

This set of 10 tests should provide a comprehensive overview of pointers and borrowing in Rust, covering basic to more complex scenarios. Each test will be designed to not only demonstrate a specific aspect of the borrowing system but also to showcase common pitfalls and best practices. Let's proceed with writing the code for these tests.

To run tests:


`cargo test -- --show-output`
