# test_function_returning_borrowed_reference

The `test_function_returning_borrowed_reference` test will demonstrate how functions in Rust can return borrowed references and the associated lifetime considerations. This is an important aspect of Rust's borrowing system, as it involves ensuring that the returned reference does not outlive the data it points to.

Test Outline:
1. Create a function that returns a borrowed reference with an explicit lifetime.
2. In the test, use the function and ensure that the lifetimes of the reference and the data it points to are correctly aligned.
3. Assert the expected outcome based on the returned reference.

Here's an example implementation:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_function_returning_borrowed_reference() {
    struct Container {
        value: i32,
    }

    impl Container {
        // Function returning a reference to 'value' with the same lifetime as 'self'
        fn get_value<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a i32 {
            &self.value
        }
    }

    let container = Container { value: 42 };
    let value_ref = container.get_value();

    assert_eq!(*value_ref, 42); // Asserting the value obtained through the reference
}
```

In this test:
- We define a `Container` struct with an `i32` field named `value`.
- We implement a method `get_value` for `Container` that returns a reference to `value`. The lifetime `'a` in `fn get_value<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a i32` indicates that the returned reference cannot outlive the `Container` instance.
- In the test, we create an instance of `Container` and then use `get_value` to obtain a reference to its `value` field.
- We assert that the value pointed to by the reference is `42`.

This test illustrates how Rust's lifetime annotations ensure that a function returning a reference does not produce dangling references. The compiler enforces that any reference returned by the function is valid for the duration of its use in the calling context.

To demonstrate the concept of references and their relation to memory addresses in Rust, we can modify the test to print the pointer addresses of both the original value in the struct and the reference returned by the function. This will help illustrate that the reference is indeed pointing to the same memory location as the original value.

Here's the modified test:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_function_returning_borrowed_reference() {
    struct Container {
        value: i32,
    }

    impl Container {
        // Function returning a reference to 'value' with the same lifetime as 'self'
        fn get_value<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a i32 {
            &self.value
        }
    }

    let container = Container { value: 42 };
    let value_ref = container.get_value();

    println!("Address of container.value: {:p}", &container.value);
    println!("Address held by value_ref: {:p}", value_ref);

    assert_eq!(*value_ref, 42); // Asserting the value obtained through the reference
}
```

In this modified test:
- The `{:p}` format specifier is used in the `println!` macro to print the pointer address.
- We print the address of `container.value` and the address held by `value_ref`.
- Since `value_ref` is a reference to `container.value`, both addresses will be the same, demonstrating that `value_ref` is indeed pointing to the `value` field of `container`.

This modification to the test will visually reinforce the concept that `value_ref` is a reference to the same memory location as `container.value`, rather than a separate copy of the value. Remember that when running tests, Rust normally suppresses output from `println!` unless the test fails or the `--nocapture` flag is used with `cargo test`.
