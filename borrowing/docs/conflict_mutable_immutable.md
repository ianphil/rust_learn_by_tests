# test_mutable_and_immutable_borrowing_conflict

For the `test_mutable_and_immutable_borrowing_conflict` test, our goal is to demonstrate Rust's borrowing rules that prevent mutable and immutable borrows of the same data from coexisting. This rule is crucial for preventing data races and ensuring safe concurrency.

Test Outline:
1. Create a function that attempts to borrow a value both mutably and immutably within the same scope, which should result in a compile-time error.
2. In the test, we will try to create a mutable borrow and an immutable borrow of the same variable and use them simultaneously.
3. The test should fail to compile, demonstrating the conflict.

Let's write a pseudo-code representation of this test since actual implementation would result in a compilation error:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_mutable_and_immutable_borrowing_conflict() {
    let mut x = 10;
    
    let immutable_borrow = &x; // Immutable borrow
    let mutable_borrow = &mut x; // Mutable borrow

    // Use both borrows here
    // ...

    // This code will not compile due to simultaneous mutable and immutable borrows
}
```

In this pseudo-code:
- `x` is a mutable integer variable.
- We attempt to create an immutable reference `immutable_borrow` and a mutable reference `mutable_borrow` to `x`.
- Rust's borrow checker will prevent this code from compiling because it violates the borrowing rules.

This test is theoretical and is designed to be an example of what not to do. It won't compile if you try to run it, and that's the intended outcome. The Rust compiler's error message will help reinforce understanding of the borrowing rules.
